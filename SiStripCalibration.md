Since January 2011 I became convener of the "<i>SiStrip Tracker Calibration, Local Reconstruction and Simulation</i>" group.
The simulation part used to be a separate group, but was merged starting from this year.

My responsibilities are to coordinate the many activities of the group making sure of providing the best possible calibration for the Silicon Strip Tracker of the CMS experiment.

Information about the group and its activities:
