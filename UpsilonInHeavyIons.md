Cross check of the 7 TeV (both 3/pb and 40/pb) and 2.76 TeV pp raw yeld ratio for 2S/1S and 3S/1S. This is needed to make sure that everything is consistent when in pp.
The cross check is done using as much as possible the cuts of heavy ions.
The results of the check are shown in the <a href="https://espace.cern.ch/cms-quarkonia/heavyion/7TeVRatio.aspx">e-space</a>.
