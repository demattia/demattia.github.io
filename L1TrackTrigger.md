## Linearized Track Fit

Development of an algorithm for a fast and accurate estimation of the track parameter. It is based on a linear fit and employs principal component analysis to derive optimal coefficients for the linear approximation in the presence of finite detector resolution. This algorithm is planned to be implemented in an FPGA and utilized in conjunction with a seeding step (such as the one provided by associative memories).
