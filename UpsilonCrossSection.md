Measurement of the Upsilon production cross section with 36/fb of 2010 data.

Besides participating in several aspects of the analysis, I directly studied the systematic uncertainty due to the trigger and muon identification efficiencies. The studies justified a reduction of the uncertainty by 30% (see the document <a href="UpsilonCrossSection/EfficiencyCorrelation.pdf">EfficiencyCorrelation</a>). This lead to a reduction of 10% in the systematic uncertainty on the final result of the analysis.
